Note: This is our first time using Godot for game development, we got into some trouble exporting the game. It was exported in DEBUG MODE in .exe format. 
If you have a anti-virus, it might get in the way trying to run the game. If you really want to try it out, you can exclude it in your anti-virus, and try 
running it
